- Repeat previous attempts
- Since the problem statements guarantees all tickets will be used, if we reached the destination but didin't use all tickets, this failed attempt will be traverse again (because we have to use all tickets).
- Per above, we are unable to accumulate useful info from failed attempts and avoid repeats
- Back track wastes previous attempts
