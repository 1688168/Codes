1473 VS 1959 VS 1043

* 1473 is not an interval DP.  last element already have all the info

* 1959 and 1043 are actually same problem.  
* resize max K times -> partition the array into K sub-arrays
  
* 1043: partition array into K subarray -> find max
* 1959: min waste -> find max in the interval and calculate the waste
