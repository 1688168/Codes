> Sorting: interval questions need to sort

- Overlapping -> sort by end point
-

> Greedy heuristics: how do you split the runtime in the defined duration?

- How to create as much overlap as possible after sorting?
- first job, running as late as possible so it has better chance to overlap with next job
- after first job, split the run-time  
  a. overlapping with priors, we might need to split into multiple parts
  b. remaining run as late as possible

> what is the data size we are dealing with?

- N=2K
