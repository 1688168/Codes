# Patterns:
# Min/Max value in sliding window
* use deque keep adding new elements from the right
  window end.  Keep popping the deque until the new 
  element is smaller than the right most member in 
  the deque.  
* the deque is always persisted in decreasing order
* max value is the first element in the deque
* reverse the logic for min member in the sliding window
