# As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command. 
# 
#  You are given a 0-indexed integer array strength, where strength[i] denotes 
# the strength of the i·µó ∞ wizard. For a contiguous group of wizards (i.e. the 
# wizards' strengths form a subarray of strength), the total strength is defined as 
# the product of the following two values: 
# 
#  
#  The strength of the weakest wizard in the group. 
#  The total of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group. 
#  
# 
#  Return the sum of the total strengths of all contiguous groups of wizards. 
# Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7. 
# 
#  A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: strength = [1,3,1,2]
# Output: 44
# Explanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards:
# - [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
# - [3] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3]) * sum([3]) = 3 * 3 = 9
# - [1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1]) * sum([1]) = 1 * 1 = 1
# - [2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([2]) * sum([2]) = 2 * 2 = 4
# - [1,3] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3]) * sum([1,3]) = 1 * 4
#  = 4
# - [3,1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3,1]) * sum([3,1]) = 1 * 4
#  = 4
# - [1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,2]) * sum([1,2]) = 1 * 3
#  = 3
# - [1,3,1] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1]) * sum([1,3,1]) =
#  1 * 5 = 5
# - [3,1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([3,1,2]) * sum([3,1,2]) =
#  1 * 6 = 6
# - [1,3,1,2] from [1,3,1,2] has a total strength of min([1,3,1,2]) * sum([1,3,1
# ,2]) = 1 * 7 = 7
# The sum of all the total strengths is 1 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 
# 44.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: strength = [5,4,6]
# Output: 213
# Explanation: The following are all the contiguous groups of wizards: 
# - [5] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([5]) * sum([5]) = 5 * 5 = 25
# - [4] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([4]) * sum([4]) = 4 * 4 = 16
# - [6] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([6]) * sum([6]) = 6 * 6 = 36
# - [5,4] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([5,4]) * sum([5,4]) = 4 * 9 =
#  36
# - [4,6] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([4,6]) * sum([4,6]) = 4 * 10 
# = 40
# - [5,4,6] from [5,4,6] has a total strength of min([5,4,6]) * sum([5,4,6]) = 4
#  * 15 = 60
# The sum of all the total strengths is 25 + 16 + 36 + 36 + 40 + 60 = 213.

Objective: subarray sum of strength
Def: strength: subarray-sum*weakest_value

idea: all subarrays is N^2
      all weakest points is O(N)
=> we need to findout how to calc sum of strength of subarrays on each weakest point

ex: given a subarray:
a x x x x ii x x x b
  1 2 3 4 ii 3 2 1
          5  6 7 8 9
where ii is the weakest wizard in subarray range (a, b) << not inclusive
      nums[a] is "prev smaller or equal"
      nums[b] is "next smaller or equal"  <<< use stack to find out

let left_cnt  = (ii-a): <0, 1, 2, 3, 4> num of combination of what left can be
    right_cnt = (b-ii): <0, 1, 2, 3> num of combination of what right can be

=> we are trying to figure out the ttl contribution of strength given ii is the weakest wizard
let new_presum = nums[a+1]*1 + nums[a+2]*2 + ...
    resum (regular) = nums[a+1] + nums[a+2] + ... (just a regular subarray sum)

left_strength: nums[ii] * (nums[a+1]*1 + nums[a+2]*2 + ... + nums[a+ii-1-a]*(ii-1-a)) * right_cnt
right_strength: nums[ii] * (nums[ii+1]*3 + nums[ii+2]*2 + ... + nums[b-1]*1) * left_cnt
             =  nums[ii] * [(b-ii-1)*(nums[ii+1]+num[ii+2]) + ... + nums[b-1]) - (nums[ii+1]*0 + nums[ii+2]*2 + ...)]
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ii_strength = num[ii] * left_cnt * right_cnt

ans=left_strength+right_strength+ii_strength
