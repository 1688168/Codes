## Word Ladder
[Word Ladder I](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/submissions/ "BFS" )
Given 1. Begin word (might not be in the dictionary)
      2. dictionary
      3. end word (part of dictionary)
Objs: Shortest transformation sequence to move from begin word to end word
      and each step change one letter that is in the dictionary
Solution Planï¼š
1. Build graph define connected words.  See below how to calc connected words.
2. BFS until we reach ending words
3. output a path


Q: how do we identify all connected words?
 a. try each pair: O(N^2)
 b. given a word (all lowercase English letters), replace with a diff letter and
    see if the new word in the dictionary
    O(N*L*25)
 => constraint: wordList size 1~5,000 => N^2   => 25,000,000
                word_length: 1~10     => 10*25 => 250

=> so we choose option B

[Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/ "BFS")
Same as word ladder I, but need to print all the feasible paths as output

Solution Plan:
- Apply solution in I.
- while building the BFS, we also record the parents (reversed graph)
- do a DFS to output all paths
